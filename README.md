# Slashmark_Task_3

ðŸ§  Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes
This project demonstrates a simple sentiment analysis model using Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Bag of Words (CountVectorizer) in Python. It processes a small dataset of user comments labeled as positive or negative.

ðŸ“‚ Project Overview
Language: Python

Libraries Used: pandas, nltk, sklearn, re

ML Model: Bernoulli Naive Bayes

Dataset: A small in-code dictionary of 10 comments with binary sentiment labels.

ðŸ›  Features
Text preprocessing: cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.

Feature extraction using CountVectorizer.

Model training with BernoulliNB.

Evaluation using accuracy and classification report.

Commands:
pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn

ðŸ“ˆ Future Ideas
Use real datasets (e.g. IMDb, Twitter)

Try other models (Logistic Regression, SVM)

Integrate with web or mobile front-end

Add TF-IDF or word embeddings
